  <h1>On the Subject of </h1>
  <h1>Mail-in Voting, Ranked Choice Voting, </h1>
  <h1>Open Primaries, and Voter Receipts</h1>

  <div class="letter">

    <p>I am reaching out as a constituent of [redacted], regarding two bills being proposed right now (SD2912 and
      HD5026)
      on
      the topic of Mail-In Voting. I urge you to support these bills in order to preserve the integrity of our
      elections,
      and give voters the best opportunity to cast their ballots. I also implore you to consider related issues that
      would
      vastly improve our voting process, Open Primaries, Ranked Choice Voting, and Voting Receipts.</p>

    <p>There are two concerns that Secretary Galvin voiced, published in <a
        href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/21/nation/mass-secretary-state-crafting-vote-by-mail-package-cautions-against-mailing-every-voter-ballot/?camp=bg:brief:rss:feedly&rss_id=feedly_rss_brief">this
        Boston Globe article</a>, that I'd like to address, as well as one of my own regarding the transparency and
      verifiability of our elections.</p>

    <h2>Open Primaries</h2>
    <p>First, is the difficulty with choosing which party's primary to send a voter. This is a clear issue not with a
      mail-in
      voting system, but rather with closed primaries. Stratifying the candidates on the ballot by party, especially in
      areas that lean towards one party, lead to a lot of candidates getting thrown out before the general, causing the
      general to take place between a popular democratic candidate, and an unpopular republican candidate (to give a MA
      example), despite the real competition being between two popular candidates in the democratic primary.</p>

    <p>We should not have primaries closed off to one party, but rather could have two rounds of voting, where then the
      two
      most popular candidates (or the five most popular, or any candidates receiving more than a percentage fo the vote)
      move on to the general election, regardless of party. This would not only solve the issue of requiring voters to
      reach
      out to get their ballot mailed, but also give our elections more integrity and give the voters more choice and
      voice
      in the elections, promoting better races between candidates.</p>

    <h2>Ranked Choice Voting</h2>
    <p>However, I do recognize that shifting from closed to open primaries is a large task. The second issue can be more
      easily fixed; Secretary Galvin mentioned that some voters that mailed in ballots early end up disenfranchised when
      their candidates drop out after their ballots are sent, but before the in-person election takes place. Again, this
      is
      not a criticism of mail in voting, but rather our method of counting votes.</p>

    <p>The solution to this is abundantly clear. I urge you to consider Ranked Choice Voting as a provision of these
      mail-in
      voting bills, as it would solve the problems Secretary Galvin has mentioned, and would also go hand in hand with
      open
      primaries, allowing the general election to easily take place between three, four or five candidates.</p>

    <p>Not only would ranked choice voting solve these problems, but it is also a common-sense measure with large
      popular
      support. Voters do not have to order candidates, but may do so if they wish, so this does not incur any undue
      burden
      on the voters. It simply allows their voice to be heard with far more clarity, as we're seeing in states and
      cities
      that have opted to utilize it.</p>

    <p>Ranked Choice Voting would be a huge improvement to our election system. Implementing it now, for use in the
      upcoming
      elections would place Massachusetts leading the charge in history towards better democracy. I'd also urge you to
      look
      to and consider states like Oregon in your deliberations. They have successful, secure Mail-In Voting utilizing a
      system similar to Ranked Choice called STAR Voting. You can read articles about the system & its use in Oregon <a
        href="https://www.starvoting.us/press">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Voting Receipts</h2>
    <p>I further urge you to implement a receipt system. Mail-In voting, while secure due to its paper trail, is not
      very
      transparent to the average voter. Nor is in-person voting, for that matter. Despite seeing my ballot go in the
      machine, I have very little confirmation that my vote is truly counted in the end results.</p>

    <p>Wyoming has solved this issue through a receipt system of their ballots. When ballots are mailed out, or a voter
      casts
      their ballot, voters should be given a small receipt to keep handy, reminding them of their ballot's ID number.
      This
      number is anonymous and not associated with the registered voter, to keep their votes confidential. Once votes
      have
      been counted, Massachusetts needs to publish a detailed record of every ballot cast in the state, as was done in
      Wyoming. The results were posted to the <a href="https://www.wyodems.org/2020caucusresults">Wyoming Democratic
        Party's
        website</a>, where anyone can view a PDF or CSV of the results (linked at the bottom of the page), and
      cross-check
      their ballot ID with the recorded value. This would promote transparency as well as data analytics, especially in
      concert with Ranked Choice Voting, to provide insight into voters' preferences.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your consideration, I would love to hear your thoughts on any of the topics I covered. Feel free to
      respond via email, or call me at [redacted]</p>
